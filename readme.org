#+title: Lisp, Numbers, and Text
#+author: Eric Gustafson

* Goal

  To create a package that will make it easy to convert between
  numerical objects and textual representations of those objects in
  common lisp.

  I'm using this package to work with numbers comming from a
  POSIX/Unix systems for scripting, systems programming, and network
  monitoring.

* Example Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :exports both
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (match
      (num-and-txt::dotted-to-vector "1.2.3.4")
    ((vector a b c d)
     (nums-and-txt::addr->dotted (vector a b c (+ d 1)))))
#+END_SRC


* Work
** TODO create a working package for num&txt
** TODO put a couple of use cases in the readme
** TODO remove ip.lisp from snot
